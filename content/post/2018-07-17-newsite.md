Started off this week with having to migrate off of AWS since my free year is
about to expire. Like all things, I went to do one simple task (Moving my
  Docker containerized Hugo app -> S3), and ended up getting sucked into the
black hole of freshening up the site as well.

Since I have my site running based off of Hugo, I had a ton of theme options to
pick from. I honestly liked this one the best just because of the large image
at the top of each page. Recently, I have started taking a lot more pictures and
I think this is another way of oversharing the great photos (I think) that I
take.

I'm going to try to start using the blogging feature more here as well. It is a
lot better than setting up WordPress, hooking that into my domain, and spending
more $$$ on something that I really do not need.

So anyway, I finally get the site to a point where I am happy with it. Then, I
think to myself, "Maybe Google Cloud has something similar that I can get another
year for free?" _Wouldn't that be great?_ Well it turns out that *YES*! You can
get a year of Google Cloud for free. All I need to do is move things into the
S3 equivalent and good to go! Plus it integrates well with Google Domains. No
setting up _Route Fiftysomething_ for me this year.
