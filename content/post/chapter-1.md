I decided today to give the site a fresh new look since I had to migrate it off
of AWS. Looks good doesn't it?


The free year of AWS was about to expire, and I was going to use S3 to host this
site on the cheap. However, I ran into Google Cloud and found that they would
give a free year. So OK, I'll do that.
